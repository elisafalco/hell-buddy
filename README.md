# HELL'BUDDY ðŸ‘¹
Hell'buddy is a website developed for the Hellfest festival (2024 edition) to record your concert program, share your program with your buddys and record your buddys' program via the website. Once the website is charged, all of it works offline (the main constraint being the lack of network on the festival site) with QR codes generation and scan.
